# Hey there 👋

I'm Nils, a backend software engineer from Germany.

I mostly work with Java and Spring Boot, building backend systems that actually survive real life (and my coding experiments).

I tinker with DevOps, automating deployments, wrangling servers, and occasionally asking myself, “Why does this OS have a mind of its own?”

I don’t reinvent the wheel… I just give it a new coat of paint.
